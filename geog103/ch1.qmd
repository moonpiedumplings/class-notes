## Temperature

* Measured using Thermometor
* Kinetic energy of molecules in the air
* indirect measurement of average kinetic energy in the air

## Conversion of Temperature

* K 
  - ⁰C + 273.15⁰
* F 
  - [9/5 * (C)] + 32 
  - Approx: F = (2 * C) + 30


## Tools To Measure Temp

* Thermometer
* Radiosonde
  - Weather Balloon, measure temp high up

## Pressure
* Formula
  - F = p * A
  - Force equals pressure over an area
* Decreases how?
  - Exponentially

## Measuring Pressure
* Barometer (tool)
* Measured in?
  - Hectopacals
